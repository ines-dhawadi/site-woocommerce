WooCommerce Shipping and Taxes offers automated tax calculation, shipping label printing, smoother payment setup, and other hosted services for WooCommerce.

== Description ==

WooCommerce Shipping and Taxes makes basic eCommerce features like shipping more reliable by taking the burden off of your site’s infrastructure.

With WooCommerce Shipping and Taxes, critical services are hosted on Automattic’s best-in-class infrastructure, rather than relying on your store’s hosting. That means your store will be more stable and faster.
To use the features, simply install this plugin and activate the ones you want directly in your dashboard. As we add more services, you’ll see more features available directly in WooCommerce – making setup simpler.
